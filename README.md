# TestKOSTA
A test task for KOSTA

The task was to:
- view company structure of departments and employees from the given DB
- view full information about a department or an employee
- make it possible to edit or add an employee

I used Entity Framework to get data from DB. For the UI I chose to use MVP pattern (the use of winforms was obligatory).

The app has two forms. The main form with a treeview and a second form to add or edit employee info.
