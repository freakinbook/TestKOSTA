# TestKOSTA
A test task for KOSTA
The task is to view company structure of departments and employees from the given DB.
I used Entity Framework to get data from DB. For the UI I chose to use MVP pattern (the use of winforms was obligatory).
The app has two forms. The main form with a treeview and a second form to add or edit employee info.
